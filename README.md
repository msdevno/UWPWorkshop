# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide content for running a workshop for working with UWP development. 
Since UWP natively is based on XAML, this workshop focuses firstly on XAML and how the it works.

In addition to dealing with UWP and XAML it is also about applying the MVVM pattern and how you can create
maintainable solutions on the UWP/XAML platform.

## Getting started

In the Source folder sits a project that is pretty much empty, it has however been set up to provide a sample of how you could 
make use of MVVM without taking on 3rd party dependencies.
